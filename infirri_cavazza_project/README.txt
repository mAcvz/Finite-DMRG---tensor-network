Our project is composed by different files:

Libraries:
- "functions_mps.py" contains the basical functions needed to work in the MPS formalism
- "functions_dmrg.py" contains the DMRG functions (Lanczos and sweeps)
- "total.py" contains the structure of the DMRG algorithm, calling all the other functions 

Run files:
- "long_run.py" calls the DMRG function using different parameters in order to probe different parameters

Graphical tools:
- "plots.html" is the code we used to create the graphical results shown in the presentation

Documents:
- "presentation.pdf" is the final presentation (of both the theory and the results part)
- "task.pdf" is the assignment document
